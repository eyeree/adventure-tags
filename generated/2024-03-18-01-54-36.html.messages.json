        "text": "We'll get into implementation details later, but first lets create an outline for a story idea.\n\nOur game engine supports three concepts: locations, items, and states. Only one location can be active at a time.\nThis is where the player is located. Items exist at a location, but can be picked up and dropped by the player.\nWhile held by the player, they move from location to location with the player. When dropped, they remain at the\nlocation where they were dropped. We'll need HTML format content describing each item and location. This can include\n<button> elements that execute JavaScript code when clicked. This code can change the current location, pickup or\ndrop items, and set or clear state variables. API details will be given after we have created an outline.\n\nThe state variables supported by the game engine lets us change what text is shown to the user as part of the\nlocation and item descriptions. Text shown can be conditional on what states are currently active. These conditions\nare described using boolean expressions that can use not, and, and or operators along with state variable names. For\nexample, a \"light\" item could have the state \"light-on\" which triggers the display of text describing what is seen\nbut only while the \"light-on\" state is active. There are a number of built in states that represent when items are\nheld, or at a particular location, or at the current location. Details on how to use these states will be provided\nlater, after we have an outline for the story to be created.\n\nThat should give you an idea of what kinds of interactive stories we can support. They can involve multiple locations,\nand items that can be picked up and moved around. You could even treat an NPC as an item that is moved around with\nthe player, or left in a particular location. And you can use state variables to make the story progress as the\nplayer performs certain actions, solves puzzles, etc.\n\nThe theme for this story you are going to create is: a whimsical fairy garden with a hidden entrance and filled will all kinds of magical items and creatures\n\nFor this story, lets aim for 5 different locations, along with some items and/or NPCs for the the\nplayer to interact with. The outline should include an overview of the story, locations, and items. Goals or\nachievements for the player. And a writing style guide for the content to be created, so that the tone and phrasing\nare consistent with the flavor of the story and the target audience."

These tags are prefixed with \"at-\".\n\nThe <at-location> tag represents a location. This tag must have an unique HTML id attribute value. All the content\ninside this tag is shown when the player is at that location, and the content for all other <at-location> tags is\nhidden. The first <at-location> tag in the document is the player's initial location.\n\nThe <at-item> tag represents an item. This tag must have an unique HTML id attribute value. These elements are moved\nfrom one <at-location> container to another when the player is carrying an item, so their content will be rendered\nalong with the player's current location.\n\nThe <at-if> tag can be used to render content conditionally. The \"state\" attribute must contain an expression that\nwill be evaluated to determine if the content of the <at-if> tag will be visible. The <at-if> tag can optionally be\nfollowed by <at-else-if> tags and an <at-else> tag. In this case, the first of the <at-if> and <at-else-if> tag's\nstate expressions that evaluates to true will make that tag's contents visible and all following <at-else-if> and\n<at-else> tag's contents will be hidden. Only if no <at-if> or <at-else-if> tag contents are shown the <at-else> tag\ncontents will be visible.\n\nThe expressions put in the \"state\" attribute can consist of state names and the \"not\", \"and\", and \"or\" boolean\noperators in that precedence order. Parentheses can be used to group sub-expressions.\n\nThe <button> tag with an \"onclick\" attribute can be used to execute javascript code in response to player input. The\nfollowing APIs are available:\n\n* setLocation(locationID) - changes the current location to the one specified by it's id. All of the items the player\n  is carrying are moved to the new location. This causes <at-if> elements in the new location to be re-evaluated.\n\n* enableState(variableName), disableState(variableName) - set or clear the specified state variable, respectively.\n  States are either enabled or disabled, arbitrary values cannot be stored as states. This causes <at-if> elements in\n  the current location to be re-evaluated. State variable names cannot contain spaces (state expressions use spaces\n  as delimiters)\n\n* takeItem(itemID), dropItem(itemID) - causes the player to pick up or put down the item specified by it's id,\n  respectively. Carried items are moved from location to location with the player.\n\n* hideItem(itemID), showItem(itemID) - show or hide the content of the <at-item> tag with the specified id. This can\n  be used to disable an item that has been used by the player, or enable an item only after a player has performed\n  some action. If you use showItem on a given item to make it appear, you can use the attribute style=\"display:none\"\n  on the <at-item> tag to make an item initially hidden. Otherwise, don't make items hidden, or they won't ever\n  visible to the player.\n\nYou can define whatever state variables you need to make the story interactive. There are some state variables\ndefined by the system, and these will be set and cleared automatically (where ‹location-id› is the id of an\n<at-location> tag and ‹item-id› is the id of an <at-item> tag):\n\n* ‹location-id›-seen - Set when the player first leaves the specified location, and never cleared. Can be used to\n  show a long description only when a location is first visited.\n\n* location-‹location-id› - Set when the player enters the specified location and cleared when the player leaves that\n  locations. Can be used to display content only while the item is at a specific location.\n\n* ‹item-id›-held - Set when the player picks up the specified item and cleared when the player drops the item. Can be\n  used to display content only while the item is being carried by the player.\n\n* ‹item-id›-present - Set when the player enters the location where the specified item is located and cleared when\n  they leave that location. Is always set for items that are being carried by the player, since this items are always\n  at the same location as the player.\n\n* ‹item-id›-‹location-id› - Set when for all items at a location when the player enters the location, including items\n  being carried by the player. Cleared for items carried by the player when they leave an location. Can be used to\n  display content when an item is at a specific location.\n\nDo not attempt to directly enable or disable any of these built in states. They will be enabled and disabled\nautomatically by the game engine when the APIs provided are called.\n\nThat's it. Now it is time to generate a complete HTML document using these tags and APIs for the story outline you\ncreated previously. Include the following head content in your generated document, so the APIs described are\navailable and the content is nicely styled.\n\n```\n    <head>\n        <title>(a title for the story)</title>\n        <script src=\"../adventure-tags.js\"></script>\n        <link href=\"../adventure-tags.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n    </head>\n```\n"

        "text": "Now create a final revision, after checking the state manipulation code and optional rendering to make sure\neverything will work as desired. When working with states, be sure to remember that it may be necessary to disable a\nstate after the player takes an action, or to drop an item after the player uses it, in order to hide obsolete\ncontent. Also be sure to include the <at-item> tag for any items you want the player to be able to take or drop, and\nthat <at-item> tag is put inside the <at-location> tag where the item will first be found by the player. And finally,\nbe sure your only using <at-*> tags that have been described. It is vital for a good player experience that the logic\nused to make the story interactive works well. Think through each possible player interaction to be sure the overall\nexperience is what you expect.\n\nAs a reminder, here are the APIs and built in states that are available.\n\nWe use custom html elements to represent locations and items, as well as to render content conditionally based on\nstates. These tags are prefixed with \"at-\".\n\nThe <at-location> tag represents a location. This tag must have an unique HTML id attribute value. All the content\ninside this tag is shown when the player is at that location, and the content for all other <at-location> tags is\nhidden. The first <at-location> tag in the document is the player's initial location.\n\nThe <at-item> tag represents an item. This tag must have an unique HTML id attribute value. These elements are moved\nfrom one <at-location> container to another when the player is carrying an item, so their content will be rendered\nalong with the player's current location.\n\nThe <at-if> tag can be used to render content conditionally. The \"state\" attribute must contain an expression that\nwill be evaluated to determine if the content of the <at-if> tag will be visible. The <at-if> tag can optionally be\nfollowed by <at-else-if> tags and an <at-else> tag. In this case, the first of the <at-if> and <at-else-if> tag's\nstate expressions that evaluates to true will make that tag's contents visible and all following <at-else-if> and\n<at-else> tag's contents will be hidden. Only if no <at-if> or <at-else-if> tag contents are shown the <at-else> tag\ncontents will be visible.\n\nThe expressions put in the \"state\" attribute can consist of state names and the \"not\", \"and\", and \"or\" boolean\noperators in that precedence order. Parentheses can be used to group sub-expressions.\n\nThe <button> tag with an \"onclick\" attribute can be used to execute javascript code in response to player input. The\nfollowing APIs are available:\n\n* setLocation(locationID) - changes the current location to the one specified by it's id. All of the items the player\n  is carrying are moved to the new location. This causes <at-if> elements in the new location to be re-evaluated.\n\n* enableState(variableName), disableState(variableName) - set or clear the specified state variable, respectively.\n  States are either enabled or disabled, arbitrary values cannot be stored as states. This causes <at-if> elements in\n  the current location to be re-evaluated. State variable names cannot contain spaces (state expressions use spaces\n  as delimiters)\n\n* takeItem(itemID), dropItem(itemID) - causes the player to pick up or put down the item specified by it's id,\n  respectively. Carried items are moved from location to location with the player.\n\n* hideItem(itemID), showItem(itemID) - show or hide the content of the <at-item> tag with the specified id. This can\n  be used to disable an item that has been used by the player, or enable an item only after a player has performed\n  some action. If you use showItem on a given item to make it appear, you can use the attribute style=\"display:none\"\n  on the <at-item> tag to make an item initially hidden. Otherwise, don't make items hidden, or they won't ever\n  visible to the player.\n\nYou can define whatever state variables you need to make the story interactive. There are some state variables\ndefined by the system, and these will be set and cleared automatically (where ‹location-id› is the id of an\n<at-location> tag and ‹item-id› is the id of an <at-item> tag):\n\n* ‹location-id›-seen - Set when the player first leaves the specified location, and never cleared. Can be used to\n  show a long description only when a location is first visited.\n\n* location-‹location-id› - Set when the player enters the specified location and cleared when the player leaves that\n  locations. Can be used to display content only while the item is at a specific location.\n\n* ‹item-id›-held - Set when the player picks up the specified item and cleared when the player drops the item. Can be\n  used to display content only while the item is being carried by the player.\n\n* ‹item-id›-present - Set when the player enters the location where the specified item is located and cleared when\n  they leave that location. Is always set for items that are being carried by the player, since this items are always\n  at the same location as the player.\n\n* ‹item-id›-‹location-id› - Set when for all items at a location when the player enters the location, including items\n  being carried by the player. Cleared for items carried by the player when they leave an location. Can be used to\n  display content when an item is at a specific location.\n\nDo not attempt to directly enable or disable any of these built in states. They will be enabled and disabled\nautomatically by the game engine when the APIs provided are called."
