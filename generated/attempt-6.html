            <p>You find yourself standing amidst the iconic monuments and stately museums of the National Mall, the lush green heart of the nation's capital. A warm breeze rustles the trees lining the wide grassy expanse before you.</p>

                <p>"Welcome, welcome to Washington D.C.!" calls out a boisterous voice. A tour guide wearing a star-spangled top hat and matching vest strides over, flashing a grin. "I'm Capital Sam, federal freeman of fun facts and freedonutor extraordinaire, at your service!"</p>
                <p>Sam thrusts a map and camera into your hands. "These'll come in handy as we hit all the patriotic pit stops on our star-spangled excursion today! The question is, where does liberty's story begin?"</p>

"Does freedom have a footprint more profound than this two-mile swath from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial?"</p>
                <p>"But enough civic scenery," Sam continues. "Let's kick off our patriotic pilgrimage with some aeronautic accomplishments!" He points dramatically. <button onclick="setLocation('air-space-museum')">To the Air and Space Museum!</button></p>

                <p>Sam pulls a pamphlet from his vest and winks conspiratorially. "Learn even more sky-high secrets by adding this to your liberty library!"</p>

                <p>"Construction on this hallowed home first began in good old 1792," Sam regales you. "Over the decades, new wings and renovations were added to its humble core structure. When the British burned it in 1814, it was rebuilt using the famous line item in the budget 'for rebuilding the President's house, known as the White House.'"</p>  
                <p>Sam leans in with a conspiratorial grin. "And just between you and me, I hear the White House kitchen is stocked with an arsenal of snacks to handle any presidential midnight cravings that arise!"</p>
