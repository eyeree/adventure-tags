Your wish has been granted, and you can't help but marvel at the power of this enchanted place.\n                    </at-if>\n                    <at-else>\n                        The glowing leaves of the Wishing Tree seem to beckon you, as if inviting you to make a wish. You could <button onclick=\"enableState('wish-granted'); disableState('wish-leaves')\">pluck a leaf and make a wish</button>, trusting in the magic of this sacred tree.\n                    </at-else>\n                </p>\n            </at-item>\n            <p>\n                You can <button onclick=\"setLocation('enchanted-pond')\">return to the Enchanted Pond</button>, your heart filled with a sense of wonder and possibility.\n            </p>\n        </at-location>\n\n        <script>\n            // Initialize the player's starting location\n            setLocation('hidden-entrance');\n        </script>\n\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this final revision, I've made the following changes to ensure the state manipulation and optional rendering work as desired:\n\n1. **Primrose Interaction**: I've added a `disableState('primrose-quest')` call when the player asks Primrose about the pixies, to ensure that the quest-related content is hidden after it has been completed.\n\n2. **Puck Interaction**: I've added a `disableState('pixie-prank')` call when the player asks Puck about the tricks, to ensure that the introduction-related content is hidden after it has been completed. I've also added a check for the `not pixie-prank` state to show the introduction button only the first time the player encounters Puck.\n\n3. **Aqua Interaction**: I've added a `disableState('puck-quest')` call when the player asks Aqua about the Wishing Tree, to ensure that the quest-related content is hidden after it has been completed.\n\n4. **Wishing Tree Interaction**: I've added a `disableState('wishing-tree')` call when the player makes a wish, to ensure that the Wishing Tree-related content is hidden after the wish has been granted. I've also hidden the `<at-item>` tag for the wish leaves initially, and only made it visible when the player can actually make a wish.\n\nBy carefully considering the player's possible actions and the corresponding state changes, I've ensured that the story progresses smoothly and that obsolete content is hidden appropriately. This should result in a more polished and enjoyable interactive experience for the player."
