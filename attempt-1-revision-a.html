            <p>A vine-covered stone archway looms before you, the entrance to a magical fairy garden. Tiny flickering lights dance around the twisted vines like pixie lanterns.</p>

            <at-if state="not entrance_gate-seen">
                <p>Through the archway you glimpse a whimsical wonderland. Towering toadstool kingdoms, a bubbling brook, and ancient crumbling stairs all overgrown with vibrant flowers and moss. But the rusty gate blocks your way, firmly shut.</p>

                    <p>Grasping the rusty key tightly, you insert it into the lock and give it a twist. <a onclick="setState('gate_open')">With an echoing creak, the gate magically swings open!</a></p>

            <p>You step into an enchanted glade, the ground soft with moss and wildflowers. Towering above are colossal red-and-white spotted mushrooms, their broad caps providing shady refuge for the tiny residents.</p>

            <p>Ahead gurgles a winding forest brook, its waters so clear you can see the colorful pebbles lining the bottom. Darting fish occasionally break the surface with a splash.</p>

            <p>The brook is too wide to simply hop across. Luckily, a trail of <a onclick="setState('lily_pads')">lily pads</a> floats along the surface, forming a bridge. But they shift and scatter with every splash!</p>

                <p>With a groan, the old wooden door swings wide, revealing a sunlit path leading up into the trees.

            <p>"Well met, wanderer," chimes a melodious voice as the queen of the faeries gracefully rises into the air before you, her gossamer wings humming. "You have proven your worth by conquering the challenges of our enchanted realm."</p>
            
            <p>"And so, as promised, I shall grant you one heartfelt wish." She spreads her arms wide, and a swirl of shimmering faerie dust engulfs you...</p>

            <p>In a dizzying rush, the world rapidly expands and shifts around you, until once more you stand at human size outside the vine-covered gate! With a wistful smile, you turn to give the magical garden one final glance before starting on your journey home, the lingering enchantment of the fairy folk warming your heart.</p>
